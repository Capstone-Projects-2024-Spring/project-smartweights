## Parts Included 
- Raspberry Pico W
- MPU-6050 3 Axis Gyroscope and Accelerometer
- USB LiPo Battery

## Design Description

This is the layout for the hardware connection between the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller and the MPU6050 sensor that it will be receiving data from. This layout will be replicated for each dumbbell and arm sleeve attachment as depicted in the [system block diagram](../requirements/system-block-diagram.md). The microcontroller transmits its data to the SmartWeights application via Bluetooth.
