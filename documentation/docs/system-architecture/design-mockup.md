The pet store is designed to present a collection of items that users can buy using the pet coins they earn. Users have the ability to click on different item tabs, such as "Pets" or
"Backgrounds", and can also sort items based on name or price. Users can preview store items with their current pet outfit by clicking on the item. This also allows users to buy the item or return back to the store page.
An alternative mockup shows how the pet store may function if there was a sale item(s).

This page is designed to show the user's overall progress. They have the ability to see the feedback for each of the workout they have done. Clicking on 'form' or 'speed' will give the user more in-depth information about that particular data. This page will also display a graph that visually shows their overall progress. They will have the ability to see a graph for just form  or just speed or both.
