# Introduction

SmartWeights is a project that presents a comprehensive approach to fitness and virtual pets. The project aims to improve both physical and mental health by helping users fix their form, as well as rewarding them for their hard work.

SmartWeights removes the need for a personal trainer through the integration of sensors and dumbbells. It provides users with a set of sensors that can be attached to any dumbbell of their choice. Users will also be provided sensors to attach to their body depending on the exercise of their choice. This allows SmartWeights to capture data about the user’s weight-lifting form and relay it to the SmartWeights mobile app. The application of SmartWeights extends beyond a traditional fitness tracking app by incorporating unique features that track the user’s exercise form and provide feedback after each set. The app will allow the user to create their own virtual pet that will motivate them to continue working out by providing feedback and through the pet’s level-up and customization system. Continuous workouts and progress will award users with a digital currency that they can then use to buy items for their pet. The virtual pet gives working out a fun and motivating experience, as not only do users get physical and mental satisfaction from working out, but they can also visually show their progress and dedication to their friends and family.
