It provides users with a set of sensors that can be attached to any dumbbell of their choice. Users will also be provided sensors to attach to their body depending on the exercise of their choice. This allows SmartWeights to capture data about the user\u2019s weight-lifting form and relay it to the SmartWeights mobile app. The application of SmartWeights extends beyond a traditional fitness tracking app by incorporating unique features that track the user\u2019s exercise form and provide feedback after each set. The app will allow the user to create their own virtual pet that will motivate them to continue working out by providing feedback and through the pet\u2019s level-up and customization system. Continuous workouts and progress will award users with a digital currency that they can then use to buy items for their pet. The virtual pet gives working out a fun and motivating experience, as not only do users get physical and mental satisfaction from working out, but they can also visually show their progress and dedication to their friends and family."})]})}function p(t={}){const{wrapper:e}={...(0,i.a)(),...t.components};return e?(0,o.jsx)(e,{...t,children:(0,o.jsx)(d,{...t})}):d(t)}},11151:(t,e,r)=>{r.d(e,{Z:()=>s,a:()=>a});var o=r(67294);const i={},n=o.createContext(i);function a(t){const e=o.useContext(n);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof t?t(e):{...e,...t}}),[e,t])}function s(t){let e;return e=t.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof t.components?t.components(i):t.components||i:a(t.components),o.createElement(n.Provider,{value:e},t.children)}}}]);
