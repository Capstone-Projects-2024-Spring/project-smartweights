It provides users with a set of sensors that can be attached to any dumbbell of their choice. This allows SmartWeights to capture data about the user\u2019s weight-lifting form and relay it to the companion mobile app. The application of SmartWeights extends beyond a traditional fitness tracking app by incorporating unique features that track the user\u2019s exercise form and provide real-time feedback using machine learning. The app will also allow the user to create a virtual pet that will motivate them to continue working out. Continuous workouts and progress will award users with a digital currency that they can then use to buy cosmetics for their virtual companion. The addition of having a virtual pet gives working out a fun and motivating experience. Not only do users get physical and mental satisfaction from working out, but they can also visually show their progress and dedication to their friends and family."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h1,{id:"conceptual-design",children:"Conceptual Design"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"SmartWeights will consist of attachable/wearable sensors sending data to an iOS application through Bluetooth.

They will also have the option to connect the app to their Apple Health with HealthKit. User accounts will be tracked and stored with Firebase\u2019s NoSQL database hosting service. Users can start their workouts using SiriKit\u2019s voice activation feature. The feedback displayed will be a generated response based on a trained machine learning (ML) model.

The idea for SmartWeights came about from the group\u2019s personal experience with weight lifting and the challenges they faced. Going to the gym can be both intimidating and inaccessible, and SmartWeights aims to solve those issues. There are similar products on the market such as Dribbleup and Kabata, but these products have a huge price point while SmartWeights will try to differentiate itself by providing advanced analytics at a reasonable price point. The idea of MacroBuddy was to create a mobile application that would combine virtual pets and healthy habits. Most health apps that involve a virtual pet only promote users to get enough daily steps, but there are a multitude of different things that can help users be healthy like working out and eating a good diet. MacroBuddy\u2019s goal was to focus on those other goals and reward users on sticking to their healthy habits. By combining these two ideas together, SmartWeights would be a cheap solution for beginner weightlifters and a way to keep them motivated to continue having healthy habits."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},11151:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{Z:()=>n,a:()=>r});var i=a(67294);const o={},s=i.createContext(o);function r(e){const t=i.useContext(s);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function n(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:r(e.components),i.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
